# Project_1-Kraken_Code

## Project Description
The project goal was to create a full website of VisualForce pages for a Salesforce organization that one of our team members created in a previous project, with each page being a pertinant feature for the business of the organization. The org that the website was centered around was a Potion Shop that sells different potions with different effects. For my portion of the project, I was tasked with creating an FAQ page for the Potion Shop that would have a table of questions that customers or potential customers of the shop would have, and the answers to said questions.

## Technologies Used
* VisualStudio Code
* Developer Console

## Features
List of features
* Table of FAQ records
* Text Input that users can use to filter through already existing questions
* If user input does not match any existing questions, a new FAQ record will be created with a default answer, both of which can be edited in the backend.

## Getting Started
git clone https://github.com/RevatureSFNTraining/Project_1-Kraken_Code.git

Get VSCode here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Make sure you have the Salesforce extensions: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode

## Usage
With the steps above completed, you can now use SFDX to authorize your org and then "deploy source in manifest to org". Once in your ORG, be sure to have myDomain and digital experiences enabled. You can then create a new "tabs + Visualforce" experience site. Just use the Visualforce pages from this project and you're all set!
